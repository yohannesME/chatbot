# ChatGPT + DALL-E Flutter Application

This Flutter application provides a user interface to interact with the ChatGPT and DALL-E models. The ChatGPT model allows you to ask questions or provide prompts for generating text responses, while the DALL-E model enables you to generate images based on textual descriptions.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (version 2.0 or above)
- Dart SDK (version 2.12 or above)
- Internet connection

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

https://github.com/yohannesME/chatbot

Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd your-repository
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
Run the application:
bash
Copy code
flutter run
Note: Ensure that you have an Android or iOS emulator running, or a physical device connected to your computer.

Usage
The application consists of two main features: ChatGPT and DALL-E. You can access these features through the respective screens.

ChatGPT
Launch the application on your device/emulator.

On the home screen, tap on the "ChatGPT" button.

You will be taken to the ChatGPT screen.

Enter your question or prompt in the input field provided.

Tap the "Send" button to submit your input.

Wait for the ChatGPT model to process your request and generate a response.

The generated response will be displayed on the screen.

DALL-E
Launch the application on your device/emulator.

On the home screen, tap on the "DALL-E" button.

You will be taken to the DALL-E screen.

Enter a textual description of the image you want to generate in the input field provided.

Tap the "Generate" button to submit your description.

Wait for the DALL-E model to process your request and generate an image based on the description.

The generated image will be displayed on the screen.

Notes
The ChatGPT model relies on an internet connection to communicate with the OpenAI API for generating responses.

The DALL-E model also requires an internet connection to send requests to the OpenAI API for image generation.

Ensure a stable internet connection to avoid any disruptions in communication with the models.

Be mindful of the prompt or description you provide to the models, as it greatly influences the generated responses or images.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or errors while running the application, ensure that your Flutter and Dart SDK versions meet the prerequisites mentioned above.

If the ChatGPT or DALL-E features do not work as expected, verify that you have a working internet connection and that the OpenAI API endpoints are accessible.
